This site provides all of the public material for PagerDuty's employee security training courses. Some sections have been redacted, as they contain confidential internal information, however those sections are clearly labelled, and a public description of the content is provided in its place.

To learn more about our philosophy behind our security training program, and why we decided to build our own, you can read [Our Approach to Employee Security Training](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/security-training-at-pagerduty), which provides more insights and background into our training program.

!!!tip ""
    These are training sessions that we have developed in-house and deliver ourselves. Your mileage may vary as to how useful they are for your own organizations. It is our hope that at the very least they can provide some insight into how we deliver our internal training and help you to develop your own training programs.

We run two internal security training courses at PagerDuty; one for all employees, and one for our engineering department (although we don't restrict who can attend the engineering training). You can find both courses below!

!!!question "Spotted a Problem?"
    Security is hard, and we're not perfect. There may be mistakes or misunderstandings in this training material. If you find a problem, please help us correct it! This project is [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/pagerduty/security-training) and we appreciate all friendly contributions.

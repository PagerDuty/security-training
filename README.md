1. Install v0.1.0 of [MkDocs Bootswatch](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs-bootswatch) `pip install mkdocs-bootswatch==0.1.0`
1. Install v0.1.1 of [MkDocs Bootstrap](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs-bootstrap) `pip install mkdocs-bootstrap==0.1.1`
1. Install v0.15.3 of [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation). `pip install mkdocs==0.15.3`

1. Install [PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/). `pip install pymdown-extensions`
1. To test locally, run `mkdocs serve` from the project directory.

## Deploying
1. Run `mkdocs build --clean` to produce the static site for upload.
1. Upload the `site` directory to S3 (or wherever you would like it to be hosted).

        aws s3 sync ./site/ s3://[BUCKET_NAME] \
          --acl public-read \
          --exclude "*.py*" \
          --delete
